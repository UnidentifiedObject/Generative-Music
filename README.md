# Generative-Music
An algorithm that will create music for you

Hello! I made this with python to try to learn more about Machine Learning. 
This code was hard for my level, but in the end, It works! 

(If it doesn't work, it means i made a mistake uploading.)

How to use:

-First you need to download the requirements file for libraries.

-Then you can add your musics to "midi_files" folder

-Then run "canYouHearTheMusic" file

-This will train your model.

-Then run "generate_and_save_music" file.

-Your new music will be in "outputMusic" folder :)
